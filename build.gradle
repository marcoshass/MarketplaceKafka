 * Applying build logic to subprojects
 * Let's continue further with our example. Here, the root project will not have any source sets as
 * all the Java code is going to be in one of the child projects. Hence, wouldn't it be wise

 * into the picture, that is, when we want to apply some build logic only on subprojects without
 * affecting the parent project. Its usage is similar to allprojects.
 * Let's just apply the java plugin to all subprojects:
